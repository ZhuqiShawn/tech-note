# tech-note
In this repo, I store all notes related to learning different technologies. Although most of the notes are in `.md` file, this repo is created using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and it is also recommended to use Obsidian to open up the project. It will be more convenient and more readable. The `.obsidian` config file is included in the repo.
